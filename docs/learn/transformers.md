# Transformers

A Transformer is a neural-network architecture built around attention and
position-wise transformations. Unlike a recurrent network that must process a
sequence step by step, a Transformer can compute representations for many
positions in parallel during training.

## Self-Attention

For each token representation, learned projections produce a query, key, and
value. Similarity between a query and keys determines attention weights; the
weighted combination of values becomes context-dependent information for that
position. In scaled dot-product attention:

<div class="display-equation" role="math" aria-label="Attention of Q, K, and V equals softmax of Q K transpose divided by the square root of d sub k, multiplied by V.">
  Attention(<var>Q</var>, <var>K</var>, <var>V</var>) =
  softmax(<var>QK</var><sup>T</sup> / √<var>d</var><sub>k</sub>)<var>V</var>
</div>

Multi-head attention repeats this operation with different learned projections,
allowing different heads to represent different interaction patterns. Residual
connections, normalization, and feed-forward layers complete a Transformer
block.

## Position and Causality

Attention alone does not encode sequence order, so Transformers add positional
information. Autoregressive decoders also use a causal mask: a position may
attend to earlier positions but not future output tokens. During generation,
the model produces one new token at a time, commonly caching earlier key and
value tensors to avoid recomputing the whole prefix.

## Architectural Families

- **Encoder-only** models build representations of an observed sequence.
- **Decoder-only** models generate sequences autoregressively and dominate
  general-purpose LLM deployments.
- **Encoder-decoder** models encode an input and generate a conditioned output.

These categories describe information flow, not a guarantee about capability.
Training data, objectives, scale, alignment, and inference methods also matter.

## Limitations

Standard attention has quadratic time and memory cost in sequence length during
full-sequence computation. Long-context systems use combinations of optimized
kernels, sparse or local attention, recurrence, compression, and retrieval.
Attention weights should not automatically be interpreted as faithful human
explanations of a model's reasoning.
