# AI Notes

AI Notes is a public, source-linked guide to language models, agents, retrieval,
and evaluation. English is the canonical source; reviewed Korean translations
are published alongside it. The site is maintained by Donghyun Lee and
published as a static GitHub Pages site.

Only reviewed public-facing material belongs in this repository. Private notes,
project records, source archives, internal paths, and operational details are
excluded.

## Quality Gates

```bash
python3 scripts/public_scan.py .
mkdocs build --strict
```

Both checks run in GitHub Actions before deployment. A failed safety scan or
strict build blocks publication.
